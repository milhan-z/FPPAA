## §1 Design

### 1.1 Problem statement & motivation (D1)

A video production - a short film, a YouTube upload, an advertisement - is a set
of **tasks** with **durations** and **precedence dependencies**. You cannot edit a
scene before it is shot, cannot colour-grade before editing, cannot publish before
rendering. A producer planning a release needs two answers:

1. **The makespan:** the earliest the whole project can finish, given the
   dependencies.
2. **The critical path:** the chain of tasks that dictates that finish time -
   the tasks with *zero scheduling freedom*. Equally important is which tasks have
   **slack** and can slip without delaying the release.

These questions matter to **indie filmmakers, content-team producers, video
agencies, and students** planning a production: the critical path tells them
where to spend money to finish sooner, and the slack tells them where a delay is
harmless. ReelPath answers both, supports **what-if** analysis (change a
duration, watch the critical path re-route), and **verifies its answer with a
second, independent algorithm**.

### 1.2 Formal model (D2)

We model an instance as a **weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG)** via
*node-splitting*, which converts task durations into edge weights so that a single
edge-weighted longest-path problem captures the whole schedule.

**Input.** Tasks `T = {1,…,k}`; each task `i` has duration `d(i) > 0`; precedence
set `P ⊆ T×T`, where `(i,j) ∈ P` means *“`i` must finish before `j` starts.”*
`P` must be **acyclic** (a cycle is an impossible schedule and is rejected).

**Graph construction.** Split task `i` into `i_in` and `i_out`:

- Vertices `V = {s, t} ∪ {i_in} ∪ {i_out}`, so `|V| = 2k + 2`.
- Edges and weights `w : E → ℝ≥0`:
  - **duration edge** `i_in → i_out`, weight `d(i)`;
  - **precedence edge** `i_out → j_in`, weight `0`, for each `(i,j) ∈ P`;
  - **source edge** `s → i_in`, weight `0`, for each task with no prerequisite;
  - **sink edge** `i_out → t`, weight `0`, for each terminal task.

**Output / objective.** The **maximum-weight path** from `s` to `t`:
`M = max over s→t paths π of Σ_{e∈π} w(e)`. Then `M` is the **makespan**; the tasks
on a maximising path form a **critical path**; per task we report
`ES, EF, LS, LF` and `slack = LS − ES`, with **critical ⇔ slack = 0**.

**Why well-defined.** In a DAG every `s→t` path is finite, so the maximum is finite
and attained. Longest path in a graph with a positive-weight cycle is unbounded
and the decision problem is NP-hard; **acyclicity is precisely what makes the
problem tractable** - and our generator and the node-split construction guarantee
it, while a cyclic user instance is detected and rejected.

**Worked instance.** `Shoot(5) → Edit(4)` becomes
`s →0→ Shoot_in →5→ Shoot_out →0→ Edit_in →4→ Edit_out →0→ t`; the only `s→t`
path has weight `9`, so the makespan is `9` and the critical path is
`Shoot → Edit`. This is a hand-checked unit test.

### 1.3 Algorithm selection & expected trade-off (D3)

Both algorithms compute a **longest `s→t` path** on the same node-split DAG, so
they must return the **same makespan** - our correctness cross-check.

- **Algorithm A - Topological sort + DAG longest path** (the non-trivial core).
  Relax vertices once each in topological order; one pass suffices because every
  predecessor is finalised first. Expected cost: **linear, `O(V+E)`**.
- **Algorithm B - Bellman–Ford on negated weights** (the baseline). Longest path =
  shortest path with weights negated; the DAG has no negative cycle, so the
  textbook `V−1`-sweep Bellman–Ford is correct. Expected cost: **`O(V·E)`** -
  quadratic in `n` for our `m ∝ n` graphs.

**Expected trade-off.** Both give the identical makespan, but A does *one* pass
while B does `V−1` sweeps over all edges. We expect a **dramatic, visible gap** on
the runtime-vs-size plot (linear vs. quadratic), which is the centrepiece of the
evaluation. B is not chosen for speed - it is an *independent* method whose
agreement with A validates both implementations.

### 1.4 Data structures & architecture (D4)

| Structure | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Adjacency list** (integer-indexed) | `graph.py` | `O(V+E)` memory; tight inner loops at `n = 10⁴` |
| **FIFO queue** | Kahn topo-sort | `O(V+E)` ordering; natural zero-indegree frontier |
| **Flat parallel edge arrays** | Bellman–Ford | minimise per-edge overhead across `V−1` sweeps |
| **`dist`/`pred` arrays** | both algorithms | `O(V)` longest-path values + path backtracking |

Integer indices (rather than hashable labels) are deliberate: at 20,002 vertices
and ~40,000 edges, Bellman–Ford touches the edge list ~`V` times, so constant
factors matter.

**Architecture.**

```

The two algorithms expose the **same interface** -
`longest_path(graph, source) → (dist, pred)` - so `schedule.py` drives either with
no duplicated logic.

<div class="page-break"></div>

## §2 Implementation

### 2.1 Module overview (I4)

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `graph.py` | `Graph` (adjacency list), `CycleError`, `build_split_dag()` (node-splitting) |
| `generator.py` | seeded **layered** DAG generator - acyclic by construction |
| `critical_path.py` | **Algorithm A** - Kahn topological sort + single-pass DAG longest path |
| `bellman_ford.py` | **Algorithm B** - Bellman–Ford on negated weights |
| `schedule.py` | forward/backward passes → `ES/EF/LS/LF/slack`; shared `analyze()` |
| `app/server.py` + `ReelPath.dc.html` | Flask demo wired to the real solver |
| `bench/benchmark.py` + `plot.py` | size sweep → `results.csv` → log–log plots |

Every module has docstrings and meaningful names; there is no copy-pasted
duplication (both algorithms share `schedule.py`) and no dead code.

### 2.2 Algorithm A - core (I1)

Kahn's algorithm raises `CycleError` exactly when the order cannot cover every
vertex (a cycle starves some in-degrees); the longest-path pass then relaxes each
edge once **for the maximum**:

```python
def topological_sort(graph):
    indeg = graph.indegree()
    queue = deque(v for v in range(graph.num_vertices) if indeg[v] == 0)
    order = []
    while queue:
        u = queue.popleft(); order.append(u)
        for v, _w in graph.adj[u]:
            indeg[v] -= 1
            if indeg[v] == 0:
                queue.append(v)
    if len(order) != graph.num_vertices:
        raise CycleError(...)          # cycle => infeasible instance
    return order

def longest_path(graph, source):       # shared interface
    dist = [NEG_INF] * graph.num_vertices; pred = [-1] * graph.num_vertices
    dist[source] = 0.0
    for u in topological_sort(graph):
        if dist[u] == NEG_INF: continue
        for v, w in graph.adj[u]:
            if dist[u] + w > dist[v]:  # relax for MAX
                dist[v] = dist[u] + w; pred[v] = u
    return dist, pred
```

### 2.3 Algorithm B - baseline (I2)

The **unconditional** `V−1`-sweep Bellman–Ford on negated weights (no early-exit,
so it shows its true `O(V·E)` cost), followed by a certificate pass:

```python
def longest_path(graph, source):
    edges = graph.edge_list()
    us = [e[0] for e in edges]; vs = [e[1] for e in edges]; ws = [e[2] for e in edges]
    sdist = [POS_INF] * n; sdist[source] = 0.0
    for _ in range(n - 1):             # V-1 full sweeps
        for k in range(len(edges)):
            du = sdist[us[k]]
            if du == POS_INF: continue
            nd = du - ws[k]            # negated weight => subtract
            if nd < sdist[vs[k]]:
                sdist[vs[k]] = nd; pred[vs[k]] = us[k]
    # certificate: on a DAG nothing may relax further (no negative cycle)
    ...
    dist = [(-d if d != POS_INF else NEG_INF) for d in sdist]
    return dist, pred                  # makespan = dist[target]
```

Returning `dist` already negated back means `schedule.py` treats A and B
identically.

### 2.4 Schedule extraction & cross-check

`analyze()` runs the forward pass (via whichever algorithm), a backward pass in
reverse topological order for `LS/LF`, computes `slack = LS − ES`, and backtracks
one critical path. The benchmark and demo call it for **both** algorithms and
assert `makespan_A == makespan_B`.

### 2.5 Demo (I3)

`python app/server.py` → http://localhost:5000. `POST /solve` returns **only real,
computed** values (makespan, critical set, full schedule, per-request `A_ms`/`B_ms`
timings, and the cross-check flag). The UI renders the production DAG with the
critical path highlighted, a Gantt chart with slack, and **what-if sliders** that
recompute everything live. Seeded sample: an 11-task short-film pipeline with
makespan **27 days**.

### 2.6 Build / run & repository (I5)

```bash
python -m venv .venv && .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q                                                   # 41 passed

python bench/plot.py
python app/server.py                                        # demo
```

Repository: **https://github.com/milhan-z/draftpaa** (public; commit history shows
incremental development). The scripts self-bootstrap `src/` onto the path, so a
clean checkout runs after `pip install -r requirements.txt` alone.

<div class="page-break"></div>

## §3 Analysis & Evaluation

### 3.1 Correctness (A1)

**Reduction.** In the node-split graph, any `s→t` path alternates
`s, a_in, a_out, b_in, b_out, …, t`, threading a chain of tasks linked by
precedence edges. Structural edges have weight `0`; only duration edges contribute,
each adding `d(i)`. Hence the weight of an `s→t` path equals the total duration of
the task chain it represents, and the **maximum-weight path equals the longest
dependency chain - which is exactly the makespan** under the Critical Path Method.

**Theorem (A is optimal).** On a DAG `G` with source `s`, relaxing vertices in
topological order with max-relaxation yields, for every vertex `u`,
`dist[u] = ` the weight of the longest `s→u` path (or `−∞` if `u` is unreachable).

**Proof (induction over the topological order).**
*Base.* `dist[s] = 0`, the weight of the empty path, which is the longest `s→s`
path. Any vertex appearing before `s` in the order is unreachable from `s`, and
its `dist` stays `−∞` - correct.
*Inductive step.* Take a vertex `u`, and assume the claim holds for every vertex
earlier in the topological order. Every predecessor `p` of `u` (an edge `p→u`)
precedes `u` in a topological order, so by the inductive hypothesis `dist[p]` was
already the true longest-path value when `p` was processed, and processing `p`
relaxed the edge `p→u`, i.e. set `dist[u] ← max(dist[u], dist[p] + w(p,u))`. After
**all** predecessors have been processed,
`dist[u] = max_{p:(p→u)∈E} (dist[p] + w(p,u))`. If `u` is reachable, an optimal
`s→u` path consists of an optimal `s→p` path followed by the edge `p→u` for some
predecessor `p`, so this maximum is exactly the longest `s→u` path weight. If `u`
is unreachable, no predecessor has finite `dist` and `dist[u] = −∞`. ∎

Taking `u = t` gives `dist[t] = M`, the makespan; backtracking `pred` from `t`
recovers a maximum-weight path. **Infeasibility:** a cyclic instance has *no*
topological order, so Kahn's algorithm cannot order all vertices and `CycleError`
is raised - the instance is rejected rather than mis-solved.

**Algorithm B is correct too.** After negating weights, the DAG has no negative
cycle, so Bellman–Ford's standard guarantee applies: after `V−1` sweeps every
shortest distance is final (any shortest path has ≤ `V−1` edges, and sweep `i`
finalises all shortest paths of `≤ i` edges). Negating back gives the longest-path
value, and the certificate pass confirms no edge relaxes further. Thus **A and B
must agree on every instance** - verified empirically in §3.5.

### 3.2 Complexity (A2)

**Algorithm A.** Computing in-degrees scans every edge once: `O(V+E)`. In Kahn's
algorithm each vertex is enqueued and dequeued exactly once (`O(V)`) and each edge
is examined exactly once when its source is dequeued (`O(E)`). The relaxation pass
visits each vertex once and each edge once: `O(V+E)`. The backward pass is another
`O(V+E)`. **Total time `O(V+E)`.** Memory: the adjacency list is `O(V+E)`; the
`dist`/`pred`/`indeg` arrays are `O(V)`. **Space `O(V+E)`.**

**Algorithm B.** The main loop runs `V−1` sweeps, each relaxing all `E` edges in
`O(1)`: **time `O(V·E)`.** The certificate pass adds `O(E)`. Memory: the flat edge
arrays and `dist`/`pred` are `O(V+E)`. **Space `O(V+E)`.**

**In terms of `n`.** With `|V| = 2n+2` and `m ≈ 3n` precedence edges (so
`|E| ≈ 4n`): **A is `O(n)`**, while **B is `O(V·E) = O(n²)`**.

| Algorithm | Time (worst case) | Time in `n` (`m ∝ n`) | Space |
|---|---|---|---|
| A - topo + DAG longest path | `O(V + E)` | `O(n)` | `O(V + E)` |
| B - Bellman–Ford (negated) | `O(V · E)` | `O(n²)` | `O(V + E)` |

### 3.3 Comparative analysis (A3)

Asymptotically **A dominates B in every regime** on a DAG: a single topological
pass versus `V−1` edge sweeps. B would only be *preferable* where its extra
generality is actually needed - arbitrary negative weights, or negative-cycle
detection - neither of which arises here, because node-splitting yields a
non-negative-weight DAG. B's role in this project is therefore an **independent
correctness oracle**: its agreement with A on every instance validates both. For a
producer's interactive what-if tool, A's linear cost is what makes live
recomputation feel instant even on large pipelines.

### 3.4 Experimental setup (A4)

- **Machine. [AUTHOR - confirm/replace]** Windows 11, Python **3.11.9** (CPython),
  single-threaded; timings via `time.perf_counter` around the **solve only**
  (each algorithm's `longest_path`); graph construction and the shared schedule
  extraction are excluded.
- **Instances.** Seeded layered DAGs, average out-degree 3 (`m ≈ 3n`), integer
  durations in `[1, 20]` (integers keep the A == B comparison exact).
- **Sizes.** `n ∈ {100, 300, 1000, 3000, 10000}` tasks (split graph
  `|V| = 2n+2`, `|E| ≈ 4n`).
- **Seeds.** `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`, fixed and printed by the harness.
- **Runs.** Algorithm A: 5 timed runs per instance. Algorithm B: scaled by its
  `O(V·E)` cost (5 runs at `n ≤ 300`, then 3 / 2 / 1 at `n = 1000 / 3000 / 10000`),
  since a single `n = 10⁴` B solve already takes ~2.5 min.
- **Reproduce:** `python bench/benchmark.py --sizes 100,300,1000,3000,10000
  --seeds 1,2,3,4,5 && python bench/plot.py`.

### 3.5 Results, theory vs. practice & cross-check (A4, A5)

<!-- RESULTS:START -->
The full sweep produced **205 timing rows over 25 instances** (5 sizes × 5 seeds).
**The `makespan_A == makespan_B` cross-check passed on all 25 instances** - every
row of `bench/results.csv` has `crosscheck_ok = 1`. Mean solve time (averaged over
seeds and runs):

| `n_tasks` | \|V\| | \|E\| | **A** mean (ms) | **B** mean (ms) | speedup B/A | makespan range |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|:--|
| 100 | 202 | 403 | 0.188 | 13.67 | 73× | 128–155 |
| 300 | 602 | 1 201 | 0.597 | 113.40 | 190× | 227–243 |
| 1 000 | 2 002 | 4 072 | 1.914 | 1 353.51 | 707× | 400–430 |
| 3 000 | 6 002 | 12 111 | 6.313 | 12 907.09 | 2 045× | 706–785 |
| 10 000 | 20 002 | 40 375 | 23.382 | 140 848.67 | 6 024× | 1 299–1 352 |

*Table 1 - mean solve time per size. A is sub-millisecond to ~23 ms; B grows from
~14 ms to ~141 s. The B/A speedup itself grows with `n` (73× → 6 024×), the
signature of a linear vs. quadratic gap.*

![Algorithm A - runtime vs n (log–log)](../bench/runtime_A.png)

![Algorithm B - runtime vs n (log–log)](../bench/runtime_B.png)

![A vs B overlay (log–log)](../bench/runtime_overlay.png)

*Figures 1–3 - log–log runtime vs. `n`. Straight lines on log–log axes indicate
power-law growth; the fitted slope is the empirical growth exponent.*

**Theory vs. practice (A5).** The least-squares slope of `log(time)` vs. `log(n)`
gives the empirical growth exponent:

| Algorithm | Empirical exponent | Derived theory |
|---|---|---|
| A - topo + DAG longest path | **1.04** | `O(V+E) = O(n)` → exponent 1.0 |
| B - Bellman–Ford (negated) | **2.02** | `O(V·E) = O(n²)` → exponent 2.0 |

Both empirical exponents land within ~0.04 of the derived values - a tight
theory–practice match. The small excess over 1.0 for A is the expected mild effect
of fixed per-call overhead at the smallest sizes (visible as a gentle bend at the
low-`n` end of Figure 1). The `6 024×` measured gap at `n = 10 000` is exactly what
a linear-vs-quadratic pair predicts.

**Cross-check (A5).** Beyond matching the theory, **the two independent algorithms
returned the identical makespan on every one of the 25 instances** (the
`crosscheck_ok` column is `1` throughout). Because A (topological relaxation) and B
(Bellman–Ford on negated weights) share no path-finding code, their agreement is
strong evidence that both implementations are correct - not merely internally
consistent.

## §4 Conclusion

### 4.1 Findings

ReelPath computes the makespan, the critical path, and per-task slack of a video
production schedule, and **two independent algorithms agree on the makespan for
every instance tested** - a strong correctness signal. The measured runtimes match
the theory closely: Algorithm A scales **linearly** and Algorithm B
**quadratically** in `n`, exactly the `O(V+E)` vs. `O(V·E)` prediction, and the
gap is enormous at scale (milliseconds vs. minutes at `n = 10⁴`).

### 4.2 Limitations

- The synthetic generator produces *layered* DAGs; real production graphs may have
  different structure (heavier fan-in, long tails). The model also assumes fixed,
  known, deterministic durations and unlimited parallel resources (no
  crew/equipment contention).
- Algorithm B's `O(V·E)` cost caps the practical sweep; we ran a single timed B
  solve at `n = 10⁴` (it is highly stable, being compute-bound).
- `[AUTHOR: add any limitation you actually observed.]`

### 4.3 Future work

- Resource-constrained scheduling (limited crews/edit bays) - an NP-hard variant
  worth an approximation/heuristic comparison (a natural **bonus** third algorithm).
- Stochastic durations (PERT / Monte-Carlo critical-path distributions).
- Incremental re-solve for what-if (update only the affected sub-DAG).

the A-vs-B gap, what the node-split trick taught you, what was hardest to debug.]`
